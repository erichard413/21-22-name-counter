Before Getting Started
There is no starting code for this project since the styling/HTML are not important. You can use whatever HTML you want.

Instructions
Create a new function component that has state for name and age
Create a text input that when updated will update the name state
Create a plus and minus button that will update the age state and display the state between the two buttons
Display the string My name is {name} and I am {age} years old in your JSX
Repeat but for a class component instead of a function component
